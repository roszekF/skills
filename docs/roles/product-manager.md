# 📋 Product Manager / Analyst

The pipeline turns your ideas into tracked, well-formed work and — when you want it — a written spec you can review before a single line of code exists. You describe the outcome; the skills dedupe against what already exists, link or author a covering spec, embed step-by-step guidance, and apply the full SDLC label set (category + priority + risk) so the backlog is ready for a developer to pick up. Nothing implements until you ask.

## Skills you'll use

| Skill | When | Example call | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`om-setup-discovery-pipeline`](../skills/om-setup-discovery-pipeline.md) | Switch the product layer on, once | `/om-setup-discovery-pipeline` | product roles, the Discovery stage, the Definition of Ready, and protected decisions in `SDLC.md`; the readiness gate every intake skill then enforces |
| [`om-discover`](../skills/om-discover.md) | Establish the product context before any idea is weighed | `/om-discover --mode client "Benefits portal"` | a `product-brief.md` built from your research folder, with every claim tagged by its evidence and every decision owned by a person — or a collection plan naming what to gather first |
| [`om-synthetic-users`](../skills/om-synthetic-users.md) | Test the brief before anyone is interviewed | `/om-synthetic-users .ai/specs/product-brief.md --flow "onboarding"` | barriers, missing cases, and contradictions as hypotheses, plus the interview plan that would settle them |
| [`om-brainstorm`](../skills/om-brainstorm.md) | Think it through before any artifact exists | `/om-brainstorm "should we build bulk-archive?"` | a routing decision with its reasoning, and a brief file the pipeline can run with |
| [`om-backlog`](../skills/om-backlog.md) | Turn the brief into a backlog | `/om-backlog .ai/specs/product-brief.md` | epics, stories with acceptance criteria, and tasks in the tracker, filed through `om-prepare-issue` after you confirm the tree |
| [`om-prepare-issue`](../skills/om-prepare-issue.md) | Park an idea as one clean issue | `/om-prepare-issue "Bulk-archive orders from the grid"` | a deduped, SDLC-labeled issue with a linked spec or step-by-step guidance |
| [`om-auto-manage-issues`](../skills/om-auto-manage-issues.md) | Triage or enrich the backlog | `/om-auto-manage-issues` | missing labels added, laconic issues clarified (screenshots analyzed), implementation-prep comment posted, feature issues without a spec flagged with a spec-required comment to their author (`--write-missing-specs` authors them instead) |
| [`om-auto-manage-issues`](../skills/om-auto-manage-issues.md) | Clean up one issue | `/om-auto-manage-issues 123` | that issue relabeled and clarified in place |
| [`om-auto-write-spec`](../skills/om-auto-write-spec.md) | Review the plan before code | `/om-auto-write-spec 123` | a spec-first PR; implementation left for a later run |
| [`om-spec-writing`](../skills/om-spec-writing.md) | Draft or review a spec directly | `/om-spec-writing` | a staff-level spec, skeleton-first with an Open Questions gate |

## What happens automatically

- **SDLC labels on creation** — category, inferred priority, and risk are applied when the issue is filed.
- **Dedupe first** — [`om-prepare-issue`](../skills/om-prepare-issue.md) searches existing issues and open PRs before creating anything.
- **Spec linkage** — a covering spec in the repo or an open PR is linked; a feature that needs one gets a spec authored on a design-only PR.
- **Claim locks** — batch triage is idempotent and claim-aware, so it never clobbers work another agent is mid-flight on.
- **Implementation-prep comments** — [`om-auto-manage-issues`](../skills/om-auto-manage-issues.md) posts a read-only analysis as a comment; it never edits code.
- **Spec gate on feature issues** — triage checks spec coverage; a feature issue without a covering spec gets a spec-required comment addressed to its author (fill up the spec before implementation), unless you run with `--write-missing-specs` to have the specs authored on design-only PRs.
- **Spec PRs get a design review** — running [`om-auto-review-pr`](../skills/om-auto-review-pr.md) on a spec-only PR applies the specification lenses (what can go wrong, backward compatibility, what's missing, improvements, is it the simplest solution) instead of the code checklist — so ask for a review on the spec PR the same way you would on code.

## Tips

- Start with [`om-brainstorm`](../skills/om-brainstorm.md) when the idea is still fuzzy — its brief's resolved-unknowns table replaces the spec's autonomous defaults downstream, so the full-auto path runs on your answers instead of the agent's guesses.
- Use `om-auto-write-spec <issue>` when you want to sign off on the approach before any implementation happens — it stops after the spec PR lands; a later [`om-auto-fix-issue`](../skills/om-auto-fix-issue.md) run picks the spec up and implements it on the same PR.
- Specs are **autonomous by default**: `om-spec-writing --autonomous` posts its Open-Questions assumptions as a comment for you to override, rather than blocking. Pass `--interactive` (on [`om-auto-fix-issue`](../skills/om-auto-fix-issue.md) / [`om-prepare-issue`](../skills/om-prepare-issue.md)) when you'd rather answer the questions live.
- To override an autonomous assumption, just reply on the PR/issue comment — the defaults are posted precisely so you can correct them.
- Batch triage defaults to the last ~25 open issues, worst-described first; narrow it by state, label, author, or limit when you want a focused pass.
- [`om-prepare-issue`](../skills/om-prepare-issue.md) files work but never implements it — reach for [`om-auto-fix-issue`](../skills/om-auto-fix-issue.md) (or a developer) when you're ready to build.
