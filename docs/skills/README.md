# Skill cards

One card per skill, with its parameters and the companion skills it works with. Each card links back to the skill's `SKILL.md` source.

**Naming convention:** the `om-auto-*` prefix marks a skill as 🤖 **autonomous** — hand it a brief, an issue, or nothing at all and it runs end-to-end without supervision (isolated worktree, validation gate, self-review, claim locks). Every other skill is 🧑‍💻 **interactive**: it acts once, may ask you questions, reports, and hands control back.

| Skill | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [om-auto-create-pr](om-auto-create-pr.md) | 🤖 | Takes a free-form task brief end-to-end to a labeled, self-reviewed PR. Resumable. |

| [om-synthetic-users](om-synthetic-users.md) | 🧑‍💻 | A fresh persona panel per run, interviews under decision pressure, a persona walk of a flow on a brief, spec, prototype, or the running app; only what repeats is a finding; parity check against real interviews; hypotheses tagged synthetic, never evidence. |

| [om-followup-issue-from-pr](om-followup-issue-from-pr.md) | 🧑‍💻 | Turns a PR or PR comment into a tracked follow-up issue. |
| [om-prepare-test-env](om-prepare-test-env.md) | 🧑‍💻 | Boots the app for QA and tests on any stack and provisions the browser provider. |
| [om-integration-tests](om-integration-tests.md) | 🧑‍💻 | Creates and runs integration/E2E tests by exploring the running app first. |
